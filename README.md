## Description
This is an application that allows a user to take notes, save notes, and delete notes.   When making a note you can provide a title to the note, and a body with information regarding the title.   Once a user clicks the save icon it will save the note.  If a user clicks the pencil icon it will create a new note.   When someone is done with the note they have the ability to delete the note.
